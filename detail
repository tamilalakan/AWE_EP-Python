I developed three websites using Django and one Angular Cli(F) + Django(B) website using API. All website code and running processes are injected in a single python code. If the user will run that python code then choose the website and then requirements will automatically be installed and run on the local server. UserDetails are provided in the project file itself. On running the website first register on the website and then further details will be displayed. If a Windows user tries to run as administrator.  Basic requirements are Python and Pip in command prompt or terminal.
